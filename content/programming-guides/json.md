Protobuf supports a canonical encoding in JSON, making it easier to share data
with systems that do not support the standard protobuf binary wire format.

ProtoJSON Format is not as efficient as protobuf wire format. The converter uses
more CPU to encode and decode messages and (except in rare cases) encoded
messages consume more space. Furthermore, ProtoJSON format puts your field and
enum value names into encoded messages making it much harder to change those
names later. Removing fields is a breaking change that will trigger a parsing
error. In short, there are many good reasons why Google prefers to use the
standard wire format for virtually everything rather than ProtoJSON format.

The encoding is described on a type-by-type basis in the table later in this
topic.

When parsing JSON-encoded data into a protocol buffer, if a value is missing or
if its value is `null`, it will be interpreted as the corresponding
[default value](./programming-guides/editions#default).
Multiple values for singular fields (using duplicate or equivalent JSON keys)
are accepted and the last value is retained, as with binary format parsing. Note
that not all protobuf JSON parser implementations are conformant, and some
nonconformant implementations may reject duplicate keys instead.

When generating JSON-encoded output from a protocol buffer, if a protobuf field
has the default value and if the field doesn't support field presence, it will
be omitted from the output by default. An implementation may provide options to
include fields with default values in the output.

Fields that have a value set and that support field presence always include the
field value in the JSON-encoded output, even if it is the default value. For
example, a proto3 field that is defined with the `optional` keyword supports
field presence and if set, will always appear in the JSON output. A message type
field in any edition of protobuf supports field presence and if set will appear
in the output. Proto3 implicit-presence scalar fields will only appear in the
JSON output if they are not set to the default value for that type.

When representing numerical data in a JSON file, if the number that is is parsed
from the wire doesn't fit in the corresponding type, you will get the same
effect as if you had cast the number to that type in C++ (for example, if a
64-bit number is read as an int32, it will be truncated to 32 bits).

The following table shows how data is represented in JSON files.

      <td>Generates JSON objects. Message field names are mapped to
        lowerCamelCase and become JSON object keys. If the
        <code>json_name</code> field option is specified, the specified value
        will be used as the key instead. Parsers accept both the lowerCamelCase
        name (or the one specified by the <code>json_name</code> option) and the
        original proto field name. <code>null</code> is an accepted value for
        all field types and treated as the default value of the corresponding
        field type. However, <code>null</code> cannot be used for the
        <code>json_name</code> value. For more on why, see

### JSON Options {#json-options}

A conformant protobuf JSON implementation may provide the following options:

*   **Always emit fields without presence**: Fields that don't support presence
    and that have their default value are omitted by default in JSON output (for
    example, an implicit presence integer with a 0 value, implicit presence
    string fields that are empty strings, and empty repeated and map fields). An
    implementation may provide an option to override this behavior and output
    fields with their default values.

    As of v25.x, the C++, Java, and Python implementations are nonconformant, as
    this flag affects proto2 `optional` fields but not proto3 `optional` fields.
    A fix is planned for a future release.

*   **Ignore unknown fields**: The protobuf JSON parser should reject unknown
    fields by default but may provide an option to ignore unknown fields in
    parsing.

*   **Use proto field name instead of lowerCamelCase name**: By default the
    protobuf JSON printer should convert the field name to lowerCamelCase and
    use that as the JSON name. An implementation may provide an option to use
    proto field name as the JSON name instead. Protobuf JSON parsers are
    required to accept both the converted lowerCamelCase name and the proto
    field name.

*   **Emit enum values as integers instead of strings**: The name of an enum
    value is used by default in JSON output. An option may be provided to use
    the numeric value of the enum value instead.
