## Removing a Reflection-related Function

In v30.x, we are removing the following reflection-related function:
`MutableRepeatedFieldRef<T>::Reserve()`.

An upcoming performance improvement in
[`RepeatedPtrField`](./reference/cpp/api-docs/google.protobuf.repeated_field#RepeatedPtrField)
is incompatible with this API. The improvement is projected to accelerate
repeated access to the elements of `RepeatedPtrField`, in particular and
especially sequential access.
