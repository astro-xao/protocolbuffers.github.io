Use the standard `fmt::Debug` ("`{:?}`" in format strings) on Protobuf messages
for human-readable strings for logging, error messages, exceptions, and similar
use cases. The output of this debug info is not intended to be machine-readable
(unlike `TextFormat` and `JSON` which are
[not be used for debug output](./best-practices/dos-donts#text-format-interchange)).

Using `fmt::Debug` enables redaction of some sensitive fields.

Note that under upb kernel this redaction is not yet implemented, but is
expected to be added.
